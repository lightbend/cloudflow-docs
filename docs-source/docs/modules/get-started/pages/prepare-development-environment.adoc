= Preparing a development environment

To develop and deploy Cloudflow applications, you will need Java, the `sbt` build tool, the Cloudflow CLI, and a Kubernetes-based platform. This page describes how to prepare for development, a later page covers the Kubernetes requirements.


== Prerequisites

First, make sure that you have the following installed:

* Java 8 (JDK)
* https://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt,window=_blank], version 1.2.8 or higher
* https://www.docker.com/community-edition[Docker,window=_blank], version 18.09 or higher
* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[helm,window=_blank], only version 2 is currently supported (Helm 3 support is WIP).
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl,window=_blank]
* https://git-scm.com/[git,window=_blank]

== Download and install the Cloudflow CLI

Using one of the links below, download the Cloudflow CLI version appropriate for your platform and install it on your local system. Please make sure you have the executable in your path with proper permission settings. For Linux or MacOS, put the executables in `usr/local/bin` with permission settings of `755`.

* https://bintray.com/lightbend/cloudflow-cli/download_file?file_path=kubectl-cloudflow-1.3.0.71-fa7ef6d-linux-amd64.tar.gz[Linux]

* https://bintray.com/lightbend/cloudflow-cli/download_file?file_path=kubectl-cloudflow-1.3.0.71-fa7ef6d-windows-amd64.tar.gz[Windows 64-bit]

NOTE:: On MacOS Catalina and later, the default behavior is to not allow unsigned executables downloaded from the internet. It is planned to sign the executable with an Apple developer certificate to fix this but in the mean time there is a very simple workaround. After downloading and unpacking the executable, please execute the following command to remove the "downloaded from the internet" filesystem flag that blocks the file from being executed:

....
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine [path to]/kubectl-cloudflow
....

More details can be found in the https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/issues/47[associated issue].
