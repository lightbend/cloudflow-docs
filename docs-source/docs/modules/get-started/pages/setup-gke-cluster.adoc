Detailed instructions on how to install a GKE cluster with Cloudflow are described in the https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/tree/master/installer[Cloudflow installer section] of the GitHub repo.

IMPORTANT: If you have a Lightbend subscription, please use the instructions in the https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cloudflow/current/install/index.html[Enterprise Features] documentation to install Cloudflow in your cluster.

To install a new cluster, clone the https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/[repo] in your local system by selecting the latest release branch or download the latest release file from https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/releases[here], go to the `installer/` folder and follow the instructions below.

* Run `gcloud init` if this is a new cluster and you are creating a GKE cluster for the first time. This command initializes the gcloud system on your local and performs necessary settings of gcloud credentials. You can have a look at the details in the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init[GKE documentation].

NOTE:: This can be done once you have a valid Google account and have access to a project set up for you by the administrator.

* Create a GKE cluster with a specific name `./create-cluster-gke.sh <cluster-name>`
* Install Cloudflow in the designated cluster `./install.sh <cluster-name> gke`

This will take you through the process of installing Cloudflow in the cluster. In course of this it will ask a few questions regarding the storage class to be installed. The following should be the response to these:

```
Select a storage class for workloads requiring persistent volumes with access mode 'ReadWriteMany'.
Examples of these are Spark and Flink checkpointing and savepointing.

   NAME                 PROVISIONER                    SUPPORTS RW?                  DEFAULT?
1. standard             kubernetes.io/gce-pd           Unknown                       -
2. nfs                  lightbend.com/nfs              Unknown                       -
> 2

Select a storage class for workloads requiring persistent volumes with access mode 'ReadWriteOnce'.
Examples of these are Kafka, Zookeeper, and Prometheus.

   NAME                 PROVISIONER                    SUPPORTS RW?                  DEFAULT?
1. standard             kubernetes.io/gce-pd           Verified                      -
2. nfs                  lightbend.com/nfs              Unknown                       -
> 1
```

It then takes you through the installation of the Cloudflow operator, the strimzi Kafka operator, the Spark operator and the Flink operator. If things go ok, you will see something like the following on your console:

```

```

The complete installtion take a bit of a time and you can follow the progress using `kubectl` command. All operators are installed in the namespace `cloudflow`. When everything is installed, you will see the following:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n cloudflow

```

This completes the process of installing the GKE cluster along with all necessary operators on it.
