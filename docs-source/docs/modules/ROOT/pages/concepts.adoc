Cloudflow allows you to quickly build and deploy distributed stream processing applications by breaking them into smaller stream processing units called `Streamlets`. Each `Streamlet` represents an independent stream processing component that implements a self-contained stage of the application logic. `Streamlets` let you break down your application into logical pieces that communicate with each other in a streaming fashion to accomplish an end to end goal. `Streamlets` can be composed into larger systems using _blueprints_, which specify how `Streamlets` can be connected together to form a topology.


In this document, we give you an overview of the main building blocks of a Cloudflow application.
We start with an overview of the `Streamlet` concept. 


== Streamlets 

`Streamlet`{empty}s are the core building blocks of a Cloudflow application. 
Each `Streamlet` represents an independent stream processing component that implements a self-contained stage of the application logic.

The lightweight `Streamlet` API exposes the raw power of the underlying runtime and its libraries while providing a higher-level abstraction for composing `streamlets` and expressing data schemas.
Your code is written in your familiar Structured Streaming, Flink, or Akka Streams native API.

Streamlets declares inlets and outlets to define the data they consume or produce.
Inlets and outlets are schema-driven, ensuring that data flows are always consistent and that connections between `Streamlets` are compatible.
The data sent between `Streamlets` is safely persisted in the underlying pub-sub system, allowing for independent lifecycle management of the different components.

=== Streamlet Shapes 

The combination of inlets and outlets give the `Streamlet` its `shape`.
Some of the commonly used streamlet shapes are the following:

Ingress
An Ingress is a streamlet with zero inlets and one or more outlets. An ingress could be a server handling requests e.g. using http.

Processor
A Processor has one inlet and one outlet. Processors represent common data transformations like map and filter, or any combination of them.

FanOut
A FanOut (also known as a Splitter) has one inlet and more than one outlets. The FanOut splits the input into multiple data streams depending on some criteria. A typical example can be an implementation of validation where the FanOut splits the input into valid and invalid data streams.

Egress
An Egress represents data leaving the Pipelines application. For instance this could be data being persisted to some database, notifications being sent to Slack, files being written to HDFS, etc.

== Blueprint

A Blueprint connects streamlets together. This is what transforms a bunch of streamlets into your application pipeline. A blueprint is written in a file using a declarative language and is part of the project.

== Application

A Cloudflow application is a collection of Streamlets and a `blueprint` definition that can be deployed as a unit to a Cloudflow-enabled cluster.

A deployed application is the runtime realization of the blueprint. 
The application pipeline gets formed according to the `Streamlets` included and the connections specified in the blueprint, materialized as data flows between the `Streamlets`.
